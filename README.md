Liri
Overview
In this assignment, I created LIRI which is a play on the term SIRI. LIRI is the command line node app that takes in parameters and gives  back data.

LIRI will search Spotify for songs, artists, ect.
Added function to default to Ace of Base "The Sign"
Added funtion to search songs and loop through all with same titles


Utilized:
Node-Spotify-API to get the data for song search.
